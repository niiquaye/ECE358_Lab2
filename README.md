# ECE358_Lab2

**Task 1**
To execute task 1 do the following: 
1. Run the following command at the root level of this directory `python3 webserver.py`
2. Go to the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:10005/orson/HelloWorld.html

Debugging: if the 'python3 webserver.py' keeps failing due unavailable port - simply re-run the command until the server starts

1. Open a shell instance and run the following command at the root level of this directory `python3 server.py`
2. Open a shell instance and run the following command at the root level of this directory `python3 client.py`
